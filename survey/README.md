🧠 5.2.1. Topic Interpretation Evaluation Methodology
We employed two complementary approaches to evaluate topic quality:
    Human Assessment
    Automated LLM Evaluation (using Deepseek R-1, Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, and ChatGPT o3)

📝 Evaluation Design

    Five topics per model were selected using coherence score stratification:
        Highest
        Upper Quartile (Q3)
        Median
        Lower Quartile (Q1)
        Lowest
    *Notes: This ensured a balanced representation of topic quality.
  
🧪 Human Evaluation Overview
The human evaluation was conducted via Google Forms from May 6th to May 20th, 2025, involving 15 English-proficient participants. Key demographic characteristics:
    Age group: 73.3% were aged 18–24 years
    Awareness: Over two-thirds had prior knowledge of Long COVID
    Relevance: This group represents a highly engaged demographic in health-related social media discourse

Each participant evaluated five representative topics per model using a 5-point Likert scale for:
    Interpretability: Clarity and coherence of topic themes
    Relevance: Connection to Long COVID discourse and experiences
The final scores were averaged per model for both criteria.
